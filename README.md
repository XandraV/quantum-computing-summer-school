The Qiskit Global Summer School 2022 is a two-week intensive summer program designed to provide a focused introduction to quantum computing and its applications to quantum simulation, with a specific focus on quantum chemistry.



## Intro to circuit composition and cost

The first Lab gives an introduction to simple one qubit gates, shows how they can be seen as rotations, multi qubit gates, some examples on how they can be used to create entangled states and the Quantum Fourier Transform as well as how to generate entangled states, with complexity theory in mind.

## Advanced circuits
The Qiskit Opflow module aims to bridge the language of quantum information theory with the framework of circuits that is used to run experiments. This will make it seamless to switch back and forth between theoretical ideas and their experimental implementation.

## Quantum Noise

The types of the quantum noise explored in this lab are: projection noise, measurement noise, coherent noise and incoherent noise. Projection noise is the noise caused by finite sampling of the wavefunction. Measurement noise is the noise affecting the physical measurement process, which is not perfect. Coherent noise is a type of noise, like over-rotation, which has a deterministic effect on our operations while incoherent noise is a non-deterministic noise which "scrambles" the quantum information in the quantum state.

## Simulate a Quantum Spin-1/2 Model
One of the leading uses for quantum computers will be to simulate quantum systems such as molecules or engineered materials. Actually executing a quantum simulation on a current quantum computer, however, can be difficult and error prone. This lab covers the simulation of a quantum spin ½ model..
